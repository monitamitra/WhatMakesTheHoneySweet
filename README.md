# What Makes the Honey So Sweet?

- Built a Random Forest model in R with around 94% accuracy to classify honey purity based on features such as pH, density, viscosity, etc. 
- Conducted exploratory data analysis using dplyr() functions, histograms, scatterplots, violin plots, etc. to uncover key trends
- Applied data preprocessing techniques such as one-hot encoding and random sampling to optimize model performance
